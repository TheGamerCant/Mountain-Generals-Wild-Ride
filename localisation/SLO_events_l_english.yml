 slovakia.1.a:0 "We have no choice..."
 
 slovakia.2.title:0 "Prague Agrees to our Demands"
 slovakia.2.desc:0 "Shock. Disbelief. Anger.\n\nThese were but some of the feelings felt by those in Prague today, as one mysterious man undid the nation-building project they had been working on for decades. They begrudgingly agreed to every, single, one of Mountain General's demands. Czechoslovakia was to be no more, and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nAcross the table, a masked man with yellow teeth grinned, and thought to himself..."
 slovakia.2.a:0 "This is where the fun begins"
 
 slovakia.3.title:0 "Slovak Soldiers Defect to our Cause"

 slovakia.4.title:0 "What IS Mountain Generalism?"
 slovakia.4.desc:0 "Mountain General was approached in his Bratislava office by Josef Tiso.\n\n'My leader, you have taken all of Slovakia to never before seen heights, but there is one pressing matter - ideology.'\n\nMountain General snapped back - 'What about ideology!'\n\n'So far all you've said in terms of your ideological standing is repeatedly calling Hungary 'gay' and 'cringe', and while undoubtedly true, one cannot lead a state on just these beliefs alone.'\n\nMountain General cooled down and responded to Tiso - 'Perhaps is is time to hammer out this whole ideology thing. We have already made great progress at attaining statehood, we now need a vision to guide us.'"

 slovakia.6.title:0 "Bratislava nights"
 slovakia.6.desc:0 "Josef Tiso couldn't sleep. He had been lying awake for hours, trying to force himself to go to sleep, but Mountain General's recent erratic behaviour caused him great distress.\n\n'It's fine,' he thought to himself, 'He knows more than we ever could'. Unable to get to sleep, he took himself for a walk.\n\nWhile walking the streets of Bratislava, Tiso came across Mountain General, intoxicated and pissing in the river.\n\n'What are you doing,' he enquired.\n\n'Pissing in the Danube so it flows down to Budapest,' Mountain General responded.\n\n'Genius - but anyways, why are you also up?'\n\n'You see, I forgot to take my crazy pills yesterday, and as such I have been beside myself and extremely energetic.'"

 slovakia.7.title:0 "Matters of Foreign Policy"
 slovakia.7.desc:0 "Another day at the conference, another day of heated debate. Today's debate primarily focused on foreign policy and Slovakia's place in the world.\n\nOne camp believes that with our great leader Mountain General at the helm, we will be undefeatable! Our enemies will tremble before the forces of the Slovakian Napoleon!\n\nThe other camp, however, believes that diplomacy is key to success - that Slovakia can position herself into a key role in this new Europe, as a beacon for all peoples, and as the leader of a new world order that puts common people first.\n\nAs per usual, the decision ultimately falls into Mountain General's hands..."

 slovakia.8.desc:0 "With the conference carrying on in full swing, questions have arisen about the powers of our government, and what the best system is for guarenteeing Slovakia's continued independence and prosperity.\n\nThere were of course the usual debates about democracy against a stronger style of governance, but a new unusual faction has emerged. Calling themselves the "Make Slovakia Great Again" movement, they advocate for total powers to Mountain General, worship of Mountain General in schools, as well as building a wall and making Hungary pay for it."
 slovakia.8.a:0 "True power comes from the people"
 slovakia.8.b:0 "We need a strong and powerful government to steer this ship"
 slovakia.8.c:0 "Fuck everyone else! Mountain General is a God among men!"
 
 slovakia.9.title:0 "Matters of Economic Policy"
 slovakia.9.desc:0 "The conference today was more heated than usual - and for good reason. Today's debates were primarily focused on the economy, many viewing it as the most important factor in the success of our Slovak state. Debates today ranged from all across the ideological spectrum.\n\nThe first major faction called for a largely free - if slightly regulated - market, believing that allowing the complex machinations of a modern economy to be run by businessmen and individuals with little government interference was the best approach to secure Slovakia's economic prosperity in our increasingly global world.\n\nAnother group praised the government interventionist economics of Italy, believing that Corporatist collaboration between the state, businessmen and the lower classes created stability and prosperity. Of this group, there were many members that also called for radical autarky such as that of Adolf Hitler's regime, believing that Slovakia should be largely self-sufficient to guarantee stability among tumultuous times.\n\nThere were finally Marxists, whom argued in favour of transferring the means of production to the workers and strengthening trade unions, as they view this as the only way to guarantee the prosperity and happiness of the lower classes.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mountain General spoke..."

 slovakia_news.1.desc:0 "After months of heavy fighting in Czechoslovakia, a masked man from the future has successfully put his forces in a position to diktat terms of surrender to the once proud Prague government. For the first time ever, Slovakia is to be an independent state, although though it's future, and perhaps the future of Europe and the world at large, is known only to one man..."
