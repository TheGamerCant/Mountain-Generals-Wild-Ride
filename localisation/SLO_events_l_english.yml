 slovakia.1.title:0 "Mountain General Demands Peace"
 slovakia.1.desc:0 "After months of heavy fighting, the bastard Mountain General has somehow taken control of most of Slovakia! He has demanded our recognition of his conquests, or else, he threatens, he will just as easily march into Prague!"
 slovakia.1.a:0 "We have no choice..."
 
 slovakia.2.title:0 "Prague Agrees to our Demands"
 slovakia.2.desc:0 "Shock. Disbelief. Anger.\n\nThese were but some of the feelings felt by those in Prague today, as one mysterious man undid the nation-building project they had been working on for decades. They begrudgingly agreed to every, single, one of Mountain General's demands. Czechoslovakia was to be no more, and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nAcross the table, a masked man with yellow teeth grinned, and thought to himself..."
 slovakia.2.a:0 "This is where the fun begins"
 
 slovakia.3.title:0 "Slovak Soldiers Defect to our Cause"
 slovakia.3.desc:0 "In face of our overwhelming victories and [SLO.GetLeader]'s brilliant genius, thousands of our Slovak brethren have refused their orders from Prague and have mutinied to our cause!"
 slovakia.3.a:0 "Our victory is inevitable."
 
 slovakia.4.title:0 "What IS Mountain Generalism?"
 slovakia.4.desc:0 "Mountain General was approached in his Bratislava office by Josef Tiso.\n\n'My leader, you have taken all of Slovakia to never before seen heights, but there is one pressing matter - ideology.'\n\nMountain General snapped back - 'What about ideology!'\n\n'So far all you've said in terms of your ideological standing is repeatedly calling Hungary 'gay' and 'cringe', and while undoubtedly true, one cannot lead a state on just these beliefs alone.'\n\nMountain General cooled down and responded to Tiso - 'Perhaps is is time to hammer out this whole ideology thing. We have already made great progress at attaining statehood, we now need a vision to guide us.'"
 slovakia.4.a:0 "Send out invitations to Slovakia's top minds at once"
 
 slovakia.5.title:0 "The Conference Begins"
 slovakia.5.desc:0 "At the request of Mountain General, many of Slovakia's top minds have assembled in a hall in Bratislava. Scientists, old Czechoslovak politicians and military officials have all assembled for this night of most importance.\n\nKicking off the event with a rousing speech, Mountain General laid forth his plans for Slovakia."
 slovakia.5.a:0 "We must make Slovakia great by destroying our Hungarian enemies!"
 slovakia.5.b:0 "Slovakia is to be a shining city upon a hill, for all of Europe to see!"
 slovakia.5.c:0 "Stability and security must come first"
 slovakia.5.d:0 "The working people of Slovakia and Europe have suffered too much!"
 
 slovakia.6.title:0 "Bratislava nights"
 slovakia.6.desc:0 "Josef Tiso couldn't sleep. He had been lying awake for hours, trying to force himself to go to sleep, but Mountain General's recent erratic behaviour caused him great distress.\n\n'It's fine,' he thought to himself, 'He knows more than we ever could'. Unable to get to sleep, he took himself for a walk.\n\nWhile walking the streets of Bratislava, Tiso came across Mountain General, intoxicated and pissing in the river.\n\n'What are you doing,' he enquired.\n\n'Pissing in the Danube so it flows down to Budapest,' Mountain General responded.\n\n'Genius - but anyways, why are you also up?'\n\n'You see, I forgot to take my crazy pills yesterday, and as such I have been beside myself and extremely energetic.'"
 slovakia.6.a:0 "'Perhaps I should take them.'"
 slovakia.6.b:0 "'And I like it!'"
 SLO_mg_goes_crazy_tt:0 "§RMountain General grows madder...§!"
 
 slovakia.7.title:0 "Matters of Foreign Policy"
 slovakia.7.desc:0 "Another day at the conference, another day of heated debate. Today's debate primarily focused on foreign policy and Slovakia's place in the world.\n\nOne camp believes that with our great leader Mountain General at the helm, we will be undefeatable! Our enemies will tremble before the forces of the Slovakian Napoleon!\n\nThe other camp, however, believes that diplomacy is key to success - that Slovakia can position herself into a key role in this new Europe, as a beacon for all peoples, and as the leader of a new world order that puts common people first.\n\nAs per usual, the decision ultimately falls into Mountain General's hands..."
 slovakia.7.a:0 "Slovakia will forge her own path in the world, lesser nations be damned!"
 slovakia.7.b:0 "Friendship with other peoples benefits all of us."
 
 slovakia.8.title:0 "The Powers of Government"
 slovakia.8.desc:0 "With the conference carrying on in full swing, questions have arisen about the powers of our government, and what the best system is for guaranteeing Slovakia's continued independence and prosperity.\n\nThere were of course the usual debates about democracy against a stronger style of governance, but a new unusual faction has emerged. Calling themselves the "Make Slovakia Great Again" movement, they advocate for total powers to Mountain General, worship of Mountain General in schools, as well as building a wall on our southern border and making Hungary pay for it."
 slovakia.8.a:0 "True power comes from the people."
 slovakia.8.b:0 "We need a strong and powerful government to steer this ship."
 slovakia.8.c:0 "Fuck everyone else! Mountain General is a God among men!"
 
 slovakia.9.title:0 "Matters of Economic Policy"
 slovakia.9.desc:0 "The conference today was more heated than usual - and for good reason. Today's debates were primarily focused on the economy, many viewing it as the most important factor in the long-term success of our Slovak state. Debates today ranged from all across the ideological spectrum.\n\nThe first major faction called for a largely free - if slightly regulated - market, believing that allowing the complex machinations of a modern economy to be run by businessmen and individuals with little government interference was the best approach to secure Slovakia's economic prosperity in our increasingly global world.\n\nAnother group praised the government interventionist economics of Italy, believing that Corporatist collaboration between the state, businessmen and the lower classes created stability and prosperity. Of this group, there were many members that also called for radical autarky such as that of Adolf Hitler's regime, believing that Slovakia should be largely self-sufficient to guarantee stability among tumultuous times.\n\nThere were finally Marxists, whom argued in favour of transferring the means of production to the workers and strengthening trade unions, as they view this as the only way to guarantee the prosperity and happiness of the lower classes.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mountain General spoke..."
 slovakia.9.a:0 "The free market is the only truly sustainable economy."
 slovakia.9.b:0 "The government must ensure the stability and well being of it's people."
 slovakia.9.c:0 "We cannot allow our economy to be reliant on foreign powers."
 slovakia.9.d:0 "The means of production belong to those who work them."
 
 slovakia.10.title:0 "The Final Day of the Conference"
 slovakia.10.desc:0 "On the final day of the Slovak national congress, all attendees gathered in Bratislava to await Mountain General's announcements. The past weeks had been devoted to determining the best policies and path to go down to lead our country in these trying times.\n\nMountain General took the stage to announce his decision."
 slovakia.10.a:0 "Slovakia holds it's breath..."
 
 slovakia.11.title:0 "The Triumph of Mountain Generalism"
 slovakia.11.desc:0 "Shock and horror reverberated across the room. The attendants fell silent, to the point you could hear a pin drop. This silence, however, wasn't to last.\n\nSoldiers began to storm the room, selecting people seemingly at random to drag from their chairs and out of the room. One by one, the other attendees rose to their feet and started chanting, at the top of their lungs:"
 slovakia.11.a:0 "Sláva Horskému Generálovi!"
 
 slovakia.12.title:0 "The Triumph of Fascism"
 slovakia.12.desc:0 "After many weeks of debating, our path forward is obvious. For Slovakia to truly prosper in the tumultuous times, we need complete national unity and strength. We must expand our borders, enforce traditional values and instil patriotism into all of our citizens, lest Slovakia be relegated to the dustbins of history alongside lesser nations."
 slovakia.12.a:0 "We will make Slovakia great!"
 
 slovakia.13.title:0 "The Triumph of Managed Democracy"
 slovakia.13.desc:0 "It was unsurprising, really. With such a great leader, and with such trying times, how could we pick anyone else, let alone risk the smelly poors from picking someone else?\n\nFor now, Mountain General is to watch over Slovakia, while making token liberalising reforms to keep the people, who had grown accustomed to Czechoslovak democracy happy."
 slovakia.13.a:0 "We will make Slovakia great!"
 
 slovakia.14.title:0 "The Triumph of Democracy"
 slovakia.14.desc:0 "With the conference coming to an end, there was no speculation as to what came next. Mountain General took the stand and began to announce a long list of democratic reforms and ideals to live up to. His speech was broadcast for all of Slovakia and the world, for Slovakia was to succeed where other nations failed, and truly be a shining city upon a hill."
 slovakia.14.a:0 "I love democracy."
 
 slovakia.15.title:0 "The Triumph of Stalinism"
 slovakia.15.desc:0 "As Mountain General took the stands to announce his intention for the workers' state, few could have predicted what came next. Soldiers loyal to Mountain General stormed the hall, grabbing the now enemies of the state from their chairs. Mountain General announced his intention to cleanse Slovakia of reactionaries and establish vanguard party rule, as to see his glorious vision of Slovakia through without interruption."
 slovakia.15.a:0 "There will be no quarter for the reactionaries!"
 
 slovakia.16.title:0 "The Triumph of Anarchism"
 slovakia.16.desc:0 "As chatter dimmed, all eyes pivoted to the stage. Mountain General had walked up to the podium wearing all black. He announded the reorganisation of Slovakia into a "Free Territory", and the abolition of the centraliised state. They were to free the working man from the shackles of oppression and spread their liberation to all of Europe!"
 slovakia.16.a:0 "Anarchia mama, za nas!"
 
 slovakia.17.title:0 "The Triumph of Socialism"
 slovakia.17.desc:0 "Moutain General took the stage after weeks of debating, ready to announce the future of the country. In his speech, he announced the introduction of Democratic Socialism to Slovakia. Slovakia was to be a worker's paradise, a shining light for all the oppressed of the world. Slovakia was not to make the mistakes of prior Communist and Socialist movements!"
 slovakia.17.a:0 "Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in a workers' paradise."
 
 slovakia.18.title:0 "Mountain General denounces Hungary"
 slovakia.18.desc:0 "'...and we must root out the Hungarian sympathisers among us. Those who claim that we should treat the southern curs with empathy either do not understand the true gravity of the situation, or are outright aiding the enemy! They speak of their so called 'human rights', but how can one reasonably argue that those inbred, Mongolian heathens, even qualify as such! We must deal to the Hungarian race a killing blow, so that...'\n\nMountain General rambled on for hours. His words captivated many Slovaks, but needless to say, the Hungarians didn't much like them."
 slovakia.18.a:0 "Glory to Slovakia! Glory  to Mountain General! Death to Hungary!"

 slovakia.19.title:0 "Mountain General denounces Germany"
 slovakia.19.desc:0 "'...They claim to be 'Aryans', and yet their people hold no resemblance to the true Aryans. The true Aryans migrated a millennia ago from the European steppes, and are today known as the Slavs! Never forget this my fellow Slovaks, that it is we, the descendents of the first peoples, who are the true Aryans!'"
 slovakia.19.a:0 "Glory to Slovakia! Glory to Mountain General! Death to the false Aryans!"
 
 slovakia.20.title:0 "Economic Downturn"
 slovakia.20.desc:0 "Following our rapid victory in our war of independence, we now have the massive task of establishing a functioning Slovak state with a competent and efficient bureaucracy.\n\nWe have taken over many former Czechoslovak ministries, construction sites and army barracks. We have also taken over many of the Slovak Škoda factories, giving us a solid base to grow our arms industry. Despite that however, transforming and stabilising the country will take time, time that we might not have..."

 slovakia.21.desc:0 "Co-founder and chairman of the far-right Slovak People's Party, Andrej Hlinka has died at the age of 78.\n\nA priest his whole life, he devoted his time to service to God and Slovakia, and was a committed nationalist and supporter of Slovak independence form both Hungary and Czechoslovakia. He leaves behind a complicated legacy as leader of such a controversial but influential party, and it seems that for as many who come out to mourn him, there are just as many who come out to celebrate."
 slovakia.21.a:0 "We will carry on his legacy."
 slovakia.21.b:0 "Rest in Piss, Fascist."
 
 slovakia.22.title:0 "Dinner Time"
 slovakia.22.desc:0 "It was a normal Bratislava night for the Holičes. They were eating dinner together in the dining room, when all of a sudden, their son, Tomáš, had something to announce.\n\n'Mama, Papa, look what we learnt in school today'. Tomáš pulled a Balaclava out of his pocket, before donning it at the table. 'Death to the Hungarians, glory to Mountain General! Don't I look Mountaineer as fuck? I got that Slovak-Záhorie ethnicity in me.'\n'That's great sweetie' Helena responded, refraining from looking up from her plate. Her husband, Petr, was not so reserved.\n\n'Take that fucking mask off NOW!' he bellowed. Tomáš was taken back. 'NOW!' His fist slammed the table in rage. Tomáš took off the Balaclava, whimpering like a scared dog.\n'You can play dictator at school all you like, but in this household, I will NOT tolerate that bastard!'"
 slovakia.22.a:0 "The only thing you could hear after that was the chewing of food."

 slovakia.23.title:0 "3AM"
 slovakia.23.desc:0 "It was another sleepless night for Helena. Although the incident was over a week ago, you always had to show a little bit of caution, which was something Petr had not done.\n'It's fine', she thought to herself, 'no-one cares.'\n\nKNOCK KNOCK\n\nShe woke up Petr, and together they ventured down the stairs, before opening the door. It was a man from the Mountain General Guards.\n'Mr and Mrs Holič, you are under arrest for anti-[SLO.GetLeader] behaviour.'\n\nPetr was drunk as usual. He didn't seem to mind, let alone know, about the gravity of the situation. Helena was the opposite. She knew full well what was to happen, yet know there was nothing she could do about it. Then, down the stairs, came Tomáš.\n'Oh Tomáš, please go back upstairs' Helena pleaded, but it was no use. Tomáš walked to the door and looked down Helena in the eyes.\n\n'Death to the Hungarians, glory to Mountain General!'"
 slovakia.23.a:0 "Knowing he was no longer her son, she accepted whatever came next."
 
 slovakia.24.title:0 "The Slovak Army"
 slovakia.24.desc:0 "The Slovak army is in a bit of a sorry state. As the lesser of two supposed equals, we were always second in line, but no more! Under Mountain General, our army will be modernised, expanded, and we will become one of the most feared armies in Europe!"

 slovakia.25.title:0 "Ethnic Violence in Southern Slovakia"
 slovakia.25.desc:0 "As a result of our new anti-Hungarian racial laws, violence and chaos has erupted in southern Slovakia. There have been large scale protests in many cities by their local Hungarian populations, and even more disatrous, some of the more radical Slovaks claim we are being too soft on the Hungarians, and have 'taken matters into their own hands'. These men have formed improvised militias, and have initiated pogrom-like cleansings against the Hungarians of the regions."
